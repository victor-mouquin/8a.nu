# Analyzing data from 8a.nu Climbing logbook

We have been analysing the 8a.nu Climbing logbook, using the data scrapped by David Cohen, available on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/dcohen21/8anu-climbing-logbook. 

After cleaning the data and getting rid of some non-sensical datapoints (e.g there are 67 climbers who started climbing before they were born) we reduced the list of users to 36031 active climbers, i.e climbers with recorded ascends. 

## Age of climbers

The bulk of climbers are between 20 and 40 years old, with and average age of 33.
